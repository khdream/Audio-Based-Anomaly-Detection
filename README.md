# Audio-Based-Anomaly-Detection-for-Industrial-Machinery-End-to-End-Project-using-MLflow-DVC
An innovative machine learning model focused on real-time anomaly detection in audio recordings of industrial pumps.

## Project Overview
The essence of this project revolves around crafting and fine-tuning a deep-learning model that can discern between normal and anomalous operational sounds from industrial pumps. We utilize the specialized pump sound subset of the MIMII Dataset, which is comprised of diverse acoustic signatures representing various operational states of industrial pumps.

## Dataset Description
The pump sound dataset is a segment of the MIMII Dataset, featuring acoustic recordings that capture the operational nuances of industrial pumps. It includes a rich tapestry of soundscapes illustrating normal functionality, as well as a series of anomalies. These recordings are complemented by ambient factory noises, rendering a realistic backdrop for the model's training and evaluation.

This project is a continuation of the Jupiter notebooks I shared in Kaggle where I used supervised learning and unsupervised learning techniques respectively.
